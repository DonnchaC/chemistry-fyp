	abstract = {In native chemical ligation, an unprotected peptide α-carboxy thioester is reacted with a second peptide containing an N-terminal cysteine residue. It was anticipated that addition of thiophenol to a native chemical ligation reaction would keep cysteine side chains reduced, catalyze the reversal of unproductive thioester formation, and generate a more reactive phenyl thioester through thiol exchange. Several model peptide?α-thioesters were treated with an excess of a competing thiol to investigate their susceptibility to thiol exchange:? a highly activated 3-nitro-4-carboxybenzyl α-thioester was smoothly converted to the less activated benzyl α-thioester through the addition of an excess of benzyl mercaptan; similarly, a peptide containing the benzyl α-thioester group was converted to a more reactive phenyl α-thioester by addition of thiophenol. Even a weakly activated peptide?α-thioester was converted to a substantially more reactive species, as demonstrated by the conversion of peptide?α{COS}-{CH}2COOH to peptide?α{COS}-phenyl. The utility of in situ transthioesterification in native chemical ligation reactions was demonstrated by model syntheses of the 110-residue barnase polypeptide chain. The use of thiophenol as an additive in the ligation gave clean, rapid reaction to form the desired amide-linked product in high yield. The in situ transthioesterification process is broadly applicable to the total chemical synthesis of proteins by native chemical ligation.},

First, we lay out a possible synthetic-biology space, which we define with a plot of complexity of components versus divergence from nature. In this scheme, there are basic units, which range from natural amino acids to totally synthetic small molecules. These are linked together to form programmable tectons, for example, amphipathic α-helices. In turn, tectons can interact to give self-assembled units, which can combine and organize further to produce functional assemblies and systems. To illustrate one path through this vast landscape, we focus on protein engineering and design. We describe how, for certain protein-folding motifs, polypeptide chains can be instructed to fold. These folds can be combined to give structured complexes, and function can be incorporated through computational design. Finally, we describe how protein-based systems may be encapsulated to control and investigate their functions.},

Due to their small size, conventional small molecule drugs may suffer from reduced target selectivity that often ultimately manifests in human side-effects, whereas protein therapeutics tend to be exquisitely specific for their targets due to many more interactions with them, but this comes at a cost of low bioavailability, poor membrane permeability, and metabolic instability. The time has now come to reinvestigate new drug leads that fit between these two molecular weight extremes, with the goal of combining advantages of small molecules (cost, conformational restriction, membrane permeability, metabolic stability, oral bioavailability) with those of proteins (natural components, target specificity, high potency). This article uses selected examples of peptides to highlight the importance of peptide drugs, some potential new opportunities for their exploitation, and some difficult challenges ahead in this field.},

Several strategies for the incorporation of these derivatives into peptide chains were investigated:? coupling without protection, with acid-labile protection, with base-labile protection, and via a novel protection strategy using the thiazolidine derivative. All amino acid derivatives were successfully coupled to various peptide resins, and with the exception of those incorporating Boc-protected derivatives, all resins yielded the desired peptide fragments. However, the coupling of the two alanine derivative diastereomers generated some epimerization.

To achieve this goal, a specific alanine residue in the parent protein is replaced with cysteine to facilitate synthesis by native chemical ligation. Following ligation, selective desulfurization of the resulting unprotected polypeptide product with H2/metal reagents converts the cysteine residue to alanine. This approach, which provides a general method to prepare alanyl proteins from their cysteinyl forms, can be used to chemically synthesize a variety of polypeptides, as demonstrated by the total chemical syntheses of the cyclic antibiotic microcin J25, the 56-amino acid streptococcal protein G B1 domain, and a variant of the 110-amino acid ribonuclease, barnase.},

  abstract = {Native chemical ligation methodology developed in the laboratory of Stephen Kent is a versatile approach to the linkage of peptide fragments using a native peptide bond. It is readily adaptable to the task of joining the N- and C-termini of peptides to produce cyclic molecules and we have used it for the cyclization of a range of disulfide-rich peptides. Specifically, it has been valuable for the synthesis of cyclotides, naturally occurring peptides characterized by a head-to-tail cyclized backbone and a knotted arrangement of three conserved disulfide bonds. Cyclotides have a diverse range of biological activities, including anti-{HIV}, antimicrobial, and insecticidal activities. They are ultrastable owing to their cyclic cystine knot motif, and native chemical ligation methodology has been invaluable in the synthesis of a range of native and modified cyclotides to explore their structure-activity relationships and applications in drug design. Similar studies have also been applied to a smaller cyclic peptide produced in sunflower seeds, sunflower trypsin inhibitor-1, which also shows promise as a template in drug design applications. We have also found native chemical ligation to be a valuable methodology for the cyclization of conotoxins, small disulfide-rich peptides from the venoms of marine cone snails. Conotoxins target a range of ions channels and receptors and are exciting leads in drug design applications. The synthetic cyclization of conotoxins with peptide linkers stabilizes them and improves their biopharmaceutical properties. In summary, this article illustrates the use of native chemical ligation technology in the cyclization of cyclotides, sunflower trypsin inhibitor-1, and conotoxins in our laboratory.},

A glycoside of 5-hydroxylysine (Hyl) was incorporated using an α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-d-galactopyranosyl/Hyl-Gly building block in a benzyl-protected form by solid-phase peptide synthesis ({SPPS}). The molecule was assembled from four segments prepared by {SPPS} via native chemical ligation ({NCL}) and thioester methods.},

  abstract = {Synthesis of erythro-N-Boc--mercapto-l-phenylalanine enables native chemical ligation at phenylalanine. In the form of the S-ethyldisulfanyl derivative, the N-Boc amino acid is used to cap a tetrapeptide generated by Fmoc-{SPPS}. The native chemical ligation with C-terminal thioesters then occurs successfully and is followed by selective desulfurization of the benzylic {CS} bond. The method is applied to the synthesis of {LYRAMFRANK}, thereby establishing compatibility with the reactive side chains and the ability to ligate other than glycine.},

  abstract = {We have completed the total chemical synthesis of cytochrome b562 and an axial ligand analogue, [{SeMet}7]cyt b562, by thioester-mediated chemical ligation of unprotected peptide segments. A novel auxiliary-mediated native chemical ligation that enables peptide ligation to be applied to protein sequences lacking cysteine was used. A cleavable thiol-containing auxiliary group, 1-phenyl-2-mercaptoethyl, was added to the α-amino group of one peptide segment to facilitate amide bond-forming ligation. The amine-linked 1-phenyl-2-mercaptoethyl auxiliary was stable to anhydrous hydrogen fluoride used to cleave and deprotect peptides after solid-phase peptide synthesis. Following native chemical ligation with a thioester-containing segment, the auxiliary group was cleanly removed from the newly formed amide bond by treatment with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, yielding a full-length unmodified polypeptide product. The resulting polypeptide was reconstituted with heme and folded to form the functional protein molecule. Synthetic wild-type cyt b562 exhibited spectroscopic and electrochemical properties identical to the recombinant protein, whereas the engineered [{SeMet}7]cyt b562 analogue protein was spectroscopically and functionally distinct, with a reduction potential shifted by ≈45 {mV}. The use of the 1-phenyl-2-mercaptoethyl removable auxiliary reported here will greatly expand the applicability of total protein synthesis by native chemical ligation of unprotected peptide segments.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we have examined two cysteine modifications resulting from sample preparation for protein characterization by {MS}: (1) a previously observed conversion of cysteine to dehydroalanine, now found in the case of disulfide mapping and (2) a novel modification corresponding to conversion of cysteine to alanine. Using model peptides, the conversion of cysteine to dehydroalanine via β-elimination of a disulfide bond was seen to result from the conditions of typical tryptic digestion (37 °C, {pH} 7.0– 9.0) without disulfide reduction and alkylation.. Furthermore, the surprising conversion of cysteine to alanine was shown to occur by heating cysteine containing peptides in the presence of a phosphine ({TCEP}). The formation of alanine from cysteine, investigated by performing experiments in H2O or D2O, suggested a radical-based desulfurization mechanism unrelated to β-elimination. Importantly, an understanding of the mechanism and conditions favorable for cysteine desulfurization provides insight for the establishment of improved sample preparation procedures of protein analysis.},
