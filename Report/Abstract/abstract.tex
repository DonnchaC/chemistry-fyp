The synthesis of two ring substituted 2-mercapto-2-phenylethyl acyl transfer auxiliaries is reported. We have demonstrated their utility in extended chemical ligation by assembling a 14 mer model peptide via cysteine-free auxiliary mediated ligation at a Gly-Gly ligation site. Finally we have tuned the auxiliary cleavage conditions to form the desired native peptide in excellent yields.
