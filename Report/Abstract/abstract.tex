The synthesis of a set of substituted 2-mercapto-2-phenylacetaldehyde native chemical ligation auxiliaries are reported. Attempts were made to characterise the post-auxiliary cleavage products in an effort elucidate the mechanism of auxiliary cleavage. The cleavage conditions for both auxiliaries were varied to explore their relative ligation and cleavage efficiencies.
